I'm happy to help! There are many Python packages and libraries that can be used for various tasks. Here are a few popular ones:\n\n1. NumPy: The NumPy package provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, and is the foundation of most scientific computing in Python.\n2. pandas: The pandas library provides data structures and functions for efficiently handling structured data, including tabular data such as spreadsheets and SQL tables.\n3. scikit-learn: The scikit-learn library provides a wide range of algorithms for machine learning tasks, including classification, regression, clustering, and more.\n4.

I'm happy to help! The Python package you're looking for is called \"len\". It's a built-in library in Python that allows you to find the length of a string, list, tuple, or other sequence.\n\nHere's an example of how you can use the \"len\" function:\n```\n>>> len(\"hello\")\n4\n```\nThis will return the length of the string \"hello\", which is 4.\n\nYou can also use the \"len\" function with lists and tuples:\n```\n>>> len([1, 2, 3])\n3\n```\nThis will return the length of the list [1, 2, 3"]]
