Subsurface scattering is a technique used in computer graphics to simulate the way light interacts with translucent materials such as skin, leaves, and wax. In subsurface scattering, light that enters a material is scattered within the material, causing it to appear translucent. This effect is particularly noticeable in skin, where light that enters the skin is scattered by the various layers of tissue, giving the skin a soft, translucent appearance.\nThe PIL library provides a number of functions for performing subsurface scattering, including the ability to apply subsurface scattering to an image, adjust the amount of scattering, and control the color and intensity of the scattering.
